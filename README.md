# This project addresses one of the most critical health issues affecting women globally: breast cancer. The data analysis in this project aims to assist doctors in making accurate diagnoses and determining the most effective treatment plans for patients. By analyzing the tumor's response to estrogen receptors and evaluating the severity and spread of the disease, the project categorizes the condition into three stages (1-2-3) representing the intensity.
